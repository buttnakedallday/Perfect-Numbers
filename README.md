# Perfect-Numbers


I wanted estimate long it would take to find the 5th perfect number (33550336) by just checking individual numbers 
in a range from 0 to X. These are all the scripts and .exe's that I used. 

perfnumbtime.exe was used to evaluate the time it would take to reach the conclusion that 33550336 is
a perfect number.

As a bonus I used the same script to created a console applacition "Console_app.exe" that doesnt push the data anywhere else,
but just solves for all the parfect numbers in a range from 0 to input(X). Feel free to play with it or even use the source 
script (perfnumbtime.py) to optimize the solution.
